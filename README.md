# Gotta Fetch() 'Em All

Welcome to **Gotta Fetch() 'Em All**! This is a fun and interactive web application built with React and Node.js, leveraging the PokeAPI to bring the excitement of Pokémon battles right to your browser. In this app, you can battle Pokémon from different areas, collect new ones, and manage your team based on your victories and defeats.

## Overview

**Gotta Fetch() 'Em All** is a single-page application that allows users to:
- Select areas to encounter and battle Pokémon.
- Capture defeated Pokémon if you win the battle.
- Lose your current Pokémon if you lose the battle.

The app is designed with a frontend in React.
